# the-simon-game
This is the project that I have learnt on an udemy course of Angela Yu.

I wanted to share this project, and I will add more features to this project so that it will be fun for me to learn and for you to play!

<h1>How to Play</h1>
<p>When you press any key on your keyboard, the game will start. </p>
If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. 
Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over.
<strong>PLAY: https://akifmertturk.github.io/the-simon-game/</strong>
