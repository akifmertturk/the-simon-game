# the-simon-game
It is a well-known game, simon, which depends on memorizing the sequence of tones and colours.

This is the project that I have learnt on a Udemy course of Angela Yu, <i>The Complete Web Development Bootcamp</i>. I have learnt the basics of the game and how to code it on the course, and then I decided to improve it so that it will be a game played with everyone around me. I am improving this little fun game at the same time improving myself in web developing.

I wanted to share this project, and I will add more features to this project so that it will be fun for me to learn and for you to play!

<h1>How to Play</h1>
<p>How to play page is added to the game in the last version. Let me explain the game here also. </p>
The game creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence.
If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex.
Once the user fails, the game is over.
